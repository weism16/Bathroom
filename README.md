# README
This program solves the unisex bathroom problem by using semaphores and shared memory to coordinate use of a single bathroom by two genders. The program reads the number of stalls from the user, and reads the time and gender of each person who enters the bathroom from unisex.txt

Run the program by uploading these files to a unix machine and compiling with gcc -o out lab6.c, then ./out
